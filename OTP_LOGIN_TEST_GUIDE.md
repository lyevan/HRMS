## 🎨 Styling Notes

- `btn-ghost` for secondary actions
- `text-error` for error messages
- `text-warning` for countdown
- Consistent with your `LoginForm.jsx` styling

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Failed to send OTP"**

   - Check email configuration in `.env`
   - Verify GMAIL_USER and GMAIL_PASS are set
   - Check server logs for email errors

2. **"No account found"**

   - Ensure the email exists in your `users` table
   - Check database connection

3. **Navigation doesn't work**

   - Verify the route is added to App.jsx
   - Check React Router imports

4. **OTP not received**
   - Check spam folder
   - Verify email template is working
   - Check server logs

Your OTP email login is production-ready and follows the same patterns as your existing authentication system! 🎉
