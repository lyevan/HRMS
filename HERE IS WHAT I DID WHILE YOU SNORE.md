## 🎯 Final Tasks Completed Tonight

### 1. ✅ **Attendance Schema Integration** (Task 11)

### 2. ✅ **Payroll Approval Workflow** (Task 12)

**What I Did:**

- **Created** `PAYROLL_APPROVAL_MIGRATION.sql` with:

  ALTER TABLE payroll_header

  ADD COLUMN approved_by character varying,
  ADD COLUMN rejected_by character varying,
  ADD CONSTRAINT fk_approved_by FOREIGN KEY (approved_by) REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
