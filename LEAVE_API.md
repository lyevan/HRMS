4. **Attendance Integration:** Approved leaves automatically create attendance records
5. **Retroactive Applications:** System supports applying for past dates (sick leave scenarios)
6. **Cancellation Window:** Can only cancel future leave requests
7. **Auto-Deduction:** Leave balances are automatically deducted upon approval
8. **Restoration:** Cancelled approved leaves restore the balance automatically
